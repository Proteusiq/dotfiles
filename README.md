<details><summary>Tips + Tricks</summary>

### Using tmux
```sh
# installl plugins
<leader> + I # prefix is <leader key> which is C-b

<leader> + c # create a new session
<leader> + n # previous session or instead of n, a <NUMBER> to switch to session
<leader> + "Shift + 2" (") or i to split horizontal
<leader> + "Shift + 5"  (%) o - to split vertical
<leader> + Arrows or hjkl # move across panes
<leader> + : # command mode (:rename-window <NAME> :rename-session <NAME> :kill-session -t <NAME or NUM>, :kill-server # kills all session)
<leader> + d # dettach session
tmux ls # list sessions
<leader> + s # list sessions

# custom
<leader> + C-p (P) # => popup window
iexit # alias to kill-session
ikill # alias to kill-server
iswitch # alias to switch-session
ipop # alias for popup window
```

### Using fzf

```sh
# search
fzf # fzf -q .py$ -e
# open files/folders with nvim
